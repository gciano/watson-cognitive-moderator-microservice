# Create a cognitive moderator chatbot for anger detection, natural language understanding and explicit images removal
In this developer journey, we will create a chatbot using IBM Functions and Watson Services. 
The chatbot flow will be enhanced by using Visual Recognition and Natural Language Understanding to identify and remove explicit images and or detect anger and ugly messages 

When the reader has completed this journey, they will understand how to:

* Create a chatbot that integrates with Slack via IBM Functions
* Use Watson Visual Recognition to detect explicit images (in beta)
* Use Watson Natural Understanding to detect emotions in a conversation
* Identify entities with Watson Natural Language Understanding
